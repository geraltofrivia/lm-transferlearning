# Domain Adversarial Training
## For Recurrent Language Models
A code base where you can find implementations of [Domain Adversarial Training](http://jmlr.org/papers/volume17/15-239/15-239.pdf), tailored for recurrent models.

The code base is designed primarily for sentence/sequence classification tasks.

## Setup
Run `setup.sh` after giving it executable permissions like so: `chmod +x setup.sh`.

## Results
This repository was used to conduct experiments for my Masters' thesis which can be now found [here](https://priyansh.page/files/thesis.pdf)
